# Welcome to pocketpy

pocketpy is a portable Python 3.x interpreter, written in C11.
It aims to be an alternative to Lua for game scripting, with elegant syntax, powerful features and competitive performance.
pocketpy has no dependencies other than the C standard library, which can be easily integrated into your C/C++ project.
Developers are able to write Python bindings via C-API or pybind11 compatible interfaces.

+ [Flutter Plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/pocketpy): Use pocketpy in Flutter apps

## What it looks like

```python
def is_prime(x):
  if x < 2:
    return False
  for i in range(2, x):
    if x % i == 0:
      return False
  return True

primes = [i for i in range(2, 20) if is_prime(i)]
print(primes)
# [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
```

## Upgrade to v2.0

pkpy v2.0 is a C11 project instead of C++17. All your existing code for v1.x won't work anymore.

We provide two API sets for v2.0, C-API and pybind11 API (C\+\+17). If you are a C user, use the C-API. If you are a C\+\+ user, use the pybind11 API.
